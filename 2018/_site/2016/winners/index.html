				<p>My team chose the “FallSafe” project as “The Most WOW Project!” and awarded them 4 Raspberry Pi development kits.
We chose this project because they used both hardware and software to create a “smart cane” that could detect if its user fell down, ask if they were OK, and if not, send for help. Reading sensors and acting on the information is part of what we do at ACSS, and the project team did an excellent job of getting their idea to work correctly. They were able to clearly and concisely describe what they did, how they did it, how they tested it, and what they were going to do next with their idea.
Our hats off to all of the participants and it was a privilege to be a part of it! We look forward to next year!</p>

				<p>Best IoT Hack</p><br>
				<h3><a href="http://devpost.com/software/endurance" target="_blank">Endurance</a></h3>
				<p>Behind everything that we do at Amazon is our drive to be "earth's most customer centric company".  As we move to the future, we continuously become more connected to everyday items through the Internet and our daily activities.  For the best IoT hack, the Endurance team showed a working prototype with potential to grow into a significantly connected device.  Their vision as well as their implementation idea and plan for extension showed us that they also thought with the end customer in mind.  The team devised a solution that was achievable yet extensible to solve a common pain in the fitness tracking space.  When challenged on why they thought their idea was related to IoT they were able to describe the extensibility beyond their developed app and connected MYO band.  Additionally, they were able to communicate this to each of our judges showing a balance between our criteria of idea and impact, a working prototype, and presentation earning our highest score.</p>

				<h2>Cisco</h2>
				<p>Most Innovative Communications Hack</p>
				<h3><a href="http://devpost.com/software/joystick-keyboard" target="_blank">Joystick Keyboard</a></h3>
				<p>We love how the team identified a problem we all can relate to, i.e. entering text without a keyboard, then came up with a solution that may have communication value far beyond their original scope. It is clear to see this idea helping people with limited mobility along with several more possibilities. The teamwork to build the device, integrate with code, learn, and have fun in the process was evident. Cisco applauds their effort. Bravo!</p>

				<p>Best use of Cisco Tech (Spark/Tropo API)</p>
				<h3><a href="http://devpost.com/software/my-little-package" target="_blank">My Little Package</a></h3>
				<p>The Cisco Team can keenly identify with the problem that the My Little Package team addressed. We have a package that was delivered to UA on Friday, but we think/hope it is still sitting in the UA mailroom. The team idenitifed a real problem, but went further to understand how package tracking data and APIs do not always work for "the last mile". Cisco applauds that not only did they hack this together, they thought about the design and scalabity too. Their use of a message queue to enable processing many notifications with resiliency and use of the Tropo/CiscoSpark APIs to send the notifications was brilliant!</p>

				<p>Most Elegant Hardware Hack</p>
				<h3><a href="http://devpost.com/software/hackaz_2016-s6p7hq" target="_blank">HackAZ_2016</a></h3>
				<p>Connor, JJ, and John developed a digital signal processing system that
could listen to audio from a musical instrument and output sheet-music
of the notes played in real-time! The system used machine learning to
train an adaptive model on the relationship between the frequency
spectrum of the instrument and the note intended. As a consequence,
the system could work over a wide range of musical instruments and
could recognize multiple notes played at the same time (chords).  They
built the entire system from concept to completion over the course of
the hack-a-thon. The team showed off a live working demo (including a
user interface) of all of these features and the judges observed that
it remained operational over the course of the day without crashing.</p>

<p>For their exemplary efforts, Connor, JJ, and John are being awarded
the GetScale Prize. They will be receiving the very first Ocean Mobile
Servers released in the United States. The Ocean, from iCracked, is a
server that fits in your pocket, needs nothing, and goes anywhere.
It's roughly the same size as the iPhone6 (not the plus!) but includes
a huge 4.2Ah battery, wireless charging, Bluetooth 4LE, and WiFi. It
can run for 2 days at full power (Dual-core 1Ghz ARM CPU) before the
battery is exhausted and can double as a power bank to fast charge
your phone at up to 2A. It comes with Linux already installed and can
be remotely programmed and controlled. You can learn more about Ocean

				<h2>Metropia</h2>
				<p>Best Transportation Hack</p>
				<h3><a href="http://devpost.com/software/tucson-flux" target="_blank">Tucson Flux</a></h3>
				<p>The Tucson Flux Team took onto the Data Visualization Challenge. The objective of the challenge was to visualize and rationalize Metropia Data, discerning the patterns and dynamic of the data. So there were two main aspects in this challenge, both of which Tucson Flux excelled at. First the visualization in a web based tool or app.The visualization is mainly composed of design and data handling. Design is key to compose a structure that will handle different types of rationalizations and its ease of interpretation, the visualization needs the computationally efficient and manage continuous flow of large amounts of data. Even though Metropia provided offline data, I liked this team's vision of practical and real live use of the tool, thus the system was designed to be able to handle that condition. The second part of the challenge was the rationalization. What Tucson Flux achieved was highly unique and ambitious. The 'inter user similarity' which is the relationship between users and space and time, this was elegantly displayed in a graph form and provided a unique visualization of the interaction of those users at a time range. This type of patterns and information is very useful in 21st century transportation urbanization will greatly change the way people commute in cities. To close Tucson Flux did an incredible job and accomplished great deal in a small time window. I hope they had as much fun developing on an interesting problem as we did supporting them!</p>

				<p>Best Drone Related Hack</p>
				<br>
				<h3><a href="http://devpost.com/software/x-terminator-drone" target="_blank">1st Place: X-Terminator Drone</a></h3>
				<p>X-Terminator Drone demonstrated a unique drone application. Their hack aims to reduce the risk of healthcare workers and volunteers in the face of an epidemic by using drones to UV sterilize the field. The advancement of their project could save lives in the future. Their hack was also technically impressive. They equipped the drone with multiple sensors and enabled autonomous flight by connecting an Arduino to the drone. This team also impressed us by leveraging their diverse strengths effectively with backgrounds in optical sciences, biomedical engineering, and computer science.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://devpost.com/software/oculus-rift-controlled-laser-turret" target="_blank">2nd Place: Oculus Rift Controlled Laser Turret</a></h3>
				<p>Oculus Rift Controller Laser Turret demonstrated a technically challenging anti-drone utility. This team had a multi disciplined group of engineering students that worked to their strengths in computer science, aerospace, and optical engineering. This team was very resourceful and used a range of hardware from marbles for their pivoting turret to drones and lasers; they even printed some 3D parts to use at the competition. Their project, an autonomous laser turret that could track and shoot down an incoming drone was very ambitious. Even though they did not demonstrate their project with all capabilities in the loop, they were able to demonstrate each part individually. Their light sensor on the drone was an innovative and safe way to test whether the drone was successfully "shot down".</p>

				<h3><a href="http://devpost.com/software/drone-flight-area-control" target="_blank">3rd Place: Drone Flight Area Control</a></h3>
				<p>Drone Flight Area Control was a hack that demonstrated a necessary drone utility tool. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are the future and their commercial effectiveness is directly dependant on how well mass amounts of them can be managed. This team took on the challenge to optimize the effectiveness of a constellation of drones. Their front end simulation leveraged google maps to display nearby tasks that the group of drones must accomplish. Their Drone Flight Area Control software would then determine the optimal solution for the drones to separate and complete all of the tasks in the least amount of time. The use case was clearly demonstrated by the team, with an excellent visual and real-time simulation.</p>

				<p>The team responsible for building iConnect fully understood how to utilize a wearable application to extend the functionality of their mobile application. The ability to filter and display only the most important job matches on the Apple Watch was a great example of this. Saving a job on the watch and being able to view the saved job on the phone illustrates an understanding of how the watch and phone communicate with each other and the power of using a wearable device on the go. The value of this application, which is to automate a process as complex as recruiting, can become a powerful tool in making sure people seeking employment and recruiters seeking talented individuals can be matched together making a best fit for both parties.</p>

				<p>This time around, Hack Arizona focused resources in people and projects rather than prizes. We are awarding Raspberry Pi 2 kits to each Hack Arizona category to provide a conduit for further experimentation and learning. Additionally, we delayed the awarding of prizes almost a full day after the event for two main reasons: to maximize the duration of Project Exposition and allow more time to deliberate and select winners.</p>
				
				<p>Congratulations again to all of our winners. A special thanks to Raytheon, Cisco, Provost Andrew Comrie, Dean Karen Williams, UA Libraries and all of our amazing Sponsors.</p>
