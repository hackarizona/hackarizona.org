                        <p>We highly recommend that out-of-state attendees reserve their plane tickets as soon as possible to minimize cost. If possible, you should fly into Tucson International Airport, as opposed to Phoenix Sky Harbor.</p> 
                        <p><strong>Tucson International</strong> -> University of Arizona - Take Bus #25 from the airport to the Ronstadt Transit Center then transfer to either the Modern Street Car, or Bus #6 to the University Boulevard stop.<br /> <a href="http://www.suntran.com/routes.php">Routes and Times Here.</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Phoenix Sky Harbor</strong> -> University of Arizona - See the options listed under in-state travel.</p>

                        <h3>Driving In</h3>
                        <p>There are a number of shuttle services from most major cities in Arizona that will take you straight to the University of Arizona campus. Links to the most reliable of these services are listed below.</p>
                        <p>Option 1 - http://arizonashuttle.com/ - This service will cost roughly 40 dollars one-way, however it is clean and offers a broad range of travel times. When choosing your drop-off point, select University.</p>
                        <p>Option 2 - https://www.greyhound.com/Express/Default.aspx - A more economic option, the Greyhound bus offers shuttle services from most cities in Arizona to downtown Tucson. The Greyhound will drop you off at the centrally-located Ronstadt Center. From the Ronstadt center, take the Suntran Streetcar to the University. The cost for a one-day Suntran pass is ~ $4.00.</p>
