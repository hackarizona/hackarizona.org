			<h1>Hack Arizona 2017</h1>

			<p>Over 830 students attended Hack Arizona for 36 hours of hacking this year. We are humbled and amazed at the incredible enthusiasm, creativity and intrepidity that hackers brought with them this weekend. It is truly a privilege to be able to serve the hacker community and spread the bug of hacking to so many students.</p>

			<p>We hope you had a blast, learned a lot and built lasting memories. We can’t wait to get started planning for next year.</p>

				<h3><a href="https://hackarizona2017.hackerearth.com/sprints/hack-arizona-1/dashboard/Here/submission/" target="_blank">Here</a></h3>
				<p>"Our hack, 'Here', was inspired by a simple problem. Picking a friend up to carpool often results in one of two undesirable situations. In the first, you arrive at your friend's house, and then text them "Here", before waiting for a few minutes for them to come out of the house and get to your car. In an effort to avoid the wait time in the first situation, many will text their friends "Here" while they're still in transit, increasing risk of car accidents and injury. 'Here' was developed as a simple solution to this problem, but has evolved into much more."</p>

Every place holds a different "vibe" and feel that create similar and different experiences for everyone and we'd hope Vibe would be able to express those feelings. The Vibe was meant for consumers to drop music on a geo location where people near by would be able to pick up and listen. Users would also be given the option to up vote certain songs to constantly change the play list of each location. Our team ended up building something similar but with static data due to time constraints. After Hack AZ, we plan to improve the app by implementing Spotify's SDK for music, create a register tool for users, and collect analytical data of what people listen to in a certain areas/environments."</p>

				<p>"The objective of this hack was to create a webpage where an individual can be able to find community activities occurring mostly in Tucson. He or she can also create events which will be stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud storage (Amazon S3). We came up with this concept, because in our own lives, we have had trouble finding community activities-- especially ones involving cultural or traditional themes. From the Pima County Official Census, the data recorded in 2013 shows that there is about 81 percent White, 4 percent Black, 3 percent Asian, 3 percent Native American, and 9 percent other or have two or more races. From this, our group realized that it would be very difficult for individual in minority groups to be able to find communities events relating to their own traditions, religion, or culture. Therefore, by creating this hack, we hope this might be the start of the realization of being able to easily connect with others with similar interests. We hope this can be improved by using for example twitter feeds to find events nearby and store them into the cloud.

				<p>"4YourHealth is an iOS app optimized for iPad which is intended to be used by Health Professionals during medical encounters in order to streamline and optimize appointments—combining voice recognition, machine learning and predictive technologies, and intuitive UI. Current patient-doctor interactions suffer from extremely outdated hardware as well as software leading to headaches for both parties. Patient's suffer through needlessly long appointments as they watch doctor's manually enter and retrieve data from their records. Health professionals suffer from decreased workflow efficiency and poor outcomes. 4YourHealth is designed to augment and eventually replace the cluttered and inefficient desktops and EMR interfaces by providing a simple yet elegant platform which provides doctor's with realtime information about patients—before they know they need it—while also eliminating the need for doctor's or patient's to take notes during an appointment. Beyond the weekend, we hope to develop connections with the major hospital networks to integrate directly with major EHR systems, which would allow us to retrieve Continuity of Care Documents (CCD) into the app on demand, as well as output our auto-generated patient summaries for consumption back into the EMR."</p>

				<p>"The objective of our hack is to streamline the process of entering contact information into your smart device. It allows an android user to take a photo of a business card and, using IBM's Watson super computer, analyze it and extract data. This data is then entered as a contact in your device. It also allows the user to speak contact information into the device and Watson extracts the relevant information and we create a contact. We have built an application for android devices that uses IBM's Watson to simplify an every day task. When starting on this project, we wanted to streamline the aforementioned process. We have now seen many more ways this service could be applicable, such as scanning in receipts and entering them into spreadsheets, reading in a syllabus and entering into a calendar, or reading quizzes and automatically grading them. We hope to add these improvements (and debug a lot!) post hackathon."</p>

				<p>"The main objective of our project is to simplify the entire job search, application and recruitment process. At the beginning of this years hack Arizona, James Whittaker, mentioned about the shift of paradigm to new technologies - less of UI stuff and so on. So our main focus is to get Alexa do all the searches for us- as both recruiters and job seekers. This project will help everyone to search their perfect career choices on the fly with the help of voice commands. Alexa will receive voice commands and search jobs for job seekers. It will also provide information about job seekers to recruiters based on the maximum matches with the given criteria. We have used the dataset provided to us by Olivia and also by using the indeed api. The main way to improve this project would be definitely to scrap more data from online job portals like Linkedin and indeed."</p>

				<h3><a href="https://hackarizona2017.hackerearth.com/sprints/hack-arizona-1/dashboard/Honey_Badgers_3/submission/" target="_blank">SkyNet</a></h3>
				<p>"Team Honey_Badgers_3 leveraged their diverse skills in their project, SkyNet. They managed complexity in their project’s materials, mechanics, 3D printing, web dev, electronics, Raspberry Pi dev, optics, and drones to successfully demonstrate each part of their end product. With minor constraints alleviated, SkyNet is capable of having a larger drone autonomously disable a smaller drone flying beneath by tracking the drone and dropping a net on it."</p>

				<p><strong>Cyber Awareness Challenge</strong></p>
				<h3>Team Blackmare</h3>
				<p>"Team Blackmare managed to defend the Parror AR.Drone by disabling  all incoming traffic and restricting the outgoing traffic to a single IP and MAC address. Additionally, they changed the SSID to a different naming convention used by the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 to make it harder for the Red Team to attack."</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Team AwesomePants</h3>
				<p>"Team AwesomePants defend strategy was based on broadcasting 1000 WiFi beacons (using the same naming scheme as the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0) which simulated WiFi hotspots. This made it real hard for the Red Team to find the “real” drone network. Additionally, they setup a honeypot as a decoy. The honeypot behaved as the drone by simulating the transmitting and response protocols."</p>

				<h3><a href="https://hackarizona2017.hackerearth.com/sprints/hack-arizona-1/dashboard/ToTALLy_noT_robOTs/submission/" target="_blank">4YourHealth</a></h3>
				<p>"4YourHealth is an iOS app optimized for iPad which is intended to be used by Health Professionals during medical encounters in order to streamline and optimize appointments—combining voice recognition, machine learning and predictive technologies, and intuitive UI. Current patient-doctor interactions suffer from extremely outdated hardware as well as software leading to headaches for both parties. Patient's suffer through needlessly long appointments as they watch doctor's manually enter and retrieve data from their records. Health professionals suffer from decreased workflow efficiency and poor outcomes. 4YourHealth is designed to augment and eventually replace the cluttered and inefficient desktops and EMR interfaces by providing a simple yet elegant platform which provides doctor's with realtime information about patients—before they know they need it—while also eliminating the need for doctor's or patient's to take notes during an appointment. Beyond the weekend, we hope to develop connections with the major hospital networks to integrate directly with major EHR systems, which would allow us to retrieve Continuity of Care Documents (CCD) into the app on demand, as well as output our auto-generated patient summaries for consumption back into the EMR."</p>
