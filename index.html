				<h2>Sponsor Prize Categories</h2>
				<li>
					<h4>Raytheon Cyber Challenge</h4>
					<p>Our cyber challenge takes on IoT devices this year! We are looking for 4 teams of 4 members to take on our challenge. Our first event will be the pre-qualifying round starting right after the HackAZ presentation. The first 4 teams to complete our pre-qualifier will get student stations, and can start working on unlocking gift cards and prizes! Each student station will be equipped with a treasure chest, protected by a smart lock. Teams will unlock them and claim the prizes inside. There will be a smart doorbell on the system that can be compromised allowing the team to gain access to a Wi-Fi network. Hack a Raspberry Pi and compromise its camera or crack a wireless router. Tackle these challenges and win BB8 robots, amazon gift cards, microcontrollers, protable solar batteries and cool swag.</p>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<ul class="faq">
				<li>
					<h4>I am still confused, what are we hacking?</h4>
					<p>"Hacking" doesn't mean malicious cyber crime, it refers to inventors, builders and creators building projects quickly and iteratively.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>What if I am a beginner or have never been to a hackathon?</h4>
					<p>Take a look at the article that was written specifically for you by a Hack Arizona organizer: <a href="https://medium.com/hack-arizona/10-questions-about-hackarizona-b3ac1df8e725">10 Questions About #HackArizona</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>What if I don't have a team or an idea?</h4>
					<p>It is more common than you would think to attend a hackathon without a solid idea or team. Many people still find great success. The hacker community is friendly and enthusiastic and you should have no problem finding a team to hack with.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>What can I build?</h4>
					<p>Anything you want: web apps, iOS apps, a website, cloud software, robotics, even a voice-controlled catapult. Be inventive. This is your weekend.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Who can attend?</h4>
					<p>Any undergraduate or graduate student (meaning enrolled in an undergraduate or graduate program) who is also over the age of 18.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
					<p>Absolutely nothing. We provide free meals over the weekend and company sponsors will be handing out swag and prizes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>What should I bring?</h4>
					<p>Besides the obvious laptop or desktop, a sleeping bag, toothbrush and other basic amenities are things to consider.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Does Hack Arizona offer travel reimbursement?</h4>
					<p>Despite our best efforts, we are unable to provide travel reimbursement to out-of-state hackers at this time. Rest-assured you will be taken care of when you arrive with a weekend of free meals, tons of swag, prizes and a comfortable environment for you and your peers.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How big can teams be?</h4>
					<p>No more than 4. It becomes difficult to manage and execute a project with a team larger than that. We highly recommend building a team of at least 3.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Where on campus is it?</h4>
					<p>The event takes place in the University of Arizona <a href="http://www.library.arizona.edu/about/libraries/scienglibr.html" target="_blank">Science and Engineering Library</a>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>What are the rules?</h4>
					<p>Pretty simple. Come build cool stuff and don't be a jerk. More info <a href="http://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf" target="_blank">here (Code of Conduct)</a>.</p>
