question: What should I bring?
answer: 'We recommend bringing everything you would for a weekend with your friends, or camping. So aside from your usual computers and things to program and hack on throughout the weekend, this includes the usual vacation items like a sleeping bag, jackets! (it sometimes gets cold in the desert),tooth brushes, tooth paste, showering items (towels, etc). You are also required to bring a copy of a government ID (drivers license), and a recent student ID card.'
