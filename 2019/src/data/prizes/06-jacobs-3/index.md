## Challenge Details
Hidden in the SEL will be special WIFI enabled books with multiple problems to be solved. The team with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the team who answered the highest valued problems wins. If that still doesn't make the winner clear, the first team to that point total wins. To start the competition, register for the challenge on the Jacobs' WIFI and visit with the Jacobs folks on the 3rd floor of the SEL to get clues to the books' locations and WIFI passwords. Books are not meant to be hacked, opened, or tampered with.
